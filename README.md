# Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project presents a machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify potentially fraudulent banking transactions. The objective is to build a classification model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent activities based on transaction data.

## Problem Statement
Financial fraud poses significant risks to banking systems and customers. This project aims to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve fraud detection accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Feature analysis
4. Model training (classification)
5. Model evaluation and accuracy measurement

## Model Performance
The trained model was evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix analysis.

## Key Features
